# Etch-a-sketch

This is an etch-a-sketch game. You can enter the box width you would like by clicking the button at the topic of the page. A grid will be generated based on the size you pick and you can then draw in the grid. The grid squares will change colour when you move the mouse over them. You cannot undo this without creating a new grid.

You can generate a new grid by clicking the button at the top of the page again anytime you would like. The number of boxes per row must be below a 100 to be able to generate the grid without an error.

Happy playing!
